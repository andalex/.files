# dotfiles
Symlink based dotfiles. My workflow is to primarily use a remote machine running with tmux in combination with the vscode ssh client.
The vim setup is decent because sometimes I use that.

## Installation:
The install script will clone this repo and add all the symlinks for each dotfile.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andalex/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash
```
